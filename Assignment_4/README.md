## Prompting Techniques Overview

### Few-Shot Prompting
Few-shot prompting provides the model with several example input-output pairs before the actual task. This helps guide the model toward the desired format and behavior, improving accuracy and consistency in its responses.

### Chain-of-Thought Prompting
Chain-of-thought prompting encourages the model to generate intermediate reasoning steps before producing a final answer. This approach is especially beneficial for complex reasoning tasks, as it helps the model break down problems and arrive at more reliable solutions.

### Context: System Prompts & Conversation History
System prompts set the model's behavior and instructions, while conversation history provides relevant context from previous exchanges. Supplying both ensures the model understands the task, maintains coherence, and produces contextually appropriate responses.
